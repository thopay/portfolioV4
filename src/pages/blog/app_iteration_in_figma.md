# Starting Out

For my S.E. (Software Engineering) 339 course I was tasked with developing an app throughout the semester. My group decided on creating an Uber inspired bike sharing/rental app. I had already worked enough with Java Spring during my John Deere internship, so I decided to work on the frontend team. We decided the first step for developing the frontend would be establishing the design system in Figma.

# First Iteration
Here was our first iteration within Figma.
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; overflow: hidden;">
	<img src="/cyclesync/1.png" style="flex: 1; max-width: 25%; height: auto;"></img>
	<img src="/cyclesync/2.png" style="flex: 1; max-width: 25%; height: auto;"></img>
	<img src="/cyclesync/3.png" style="flex: 1; max-width: 25%; height: auto;"></img>
	<img src="/cyclesync/4.png" style="flex: 1; max-width: 25%; height: auto;"></img>
</div>

We felt this design was a good starting point, but was still a little outdated.

# Second Iteration
We wanted the app to be more modern and minimalist... this is our most recent version (as of 8/31/23).
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; overflow: hidden;">
	<img src="/cyclesync/5.png" style="flex: 1; max-width: 25%; height: auto;"></img>
	<img src="/cyclesync/6.png" style="flex: 1; max-width: 25%; height: auto;"></img>
	<img src="/cyclesync/7.png" style="flex: 1; max-width: 25%; height: auto;"></img>
	<img src="/cyclesync/8.png" style="flex: 1; max-width: 25%; height: auto;"></img>
</div>
